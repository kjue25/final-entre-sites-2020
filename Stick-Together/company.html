        We are a group of seventh graders who are working together to create our first company.             We are very excited to grow throughout this process, and we hope to interest you in our designs and product.
        Our team consists of four people: Penelope, Jasmeet, Lillian, and Ananya. 
        All four of us are interested in art and drawing, and making stickers,
        a popular product that combines our interests.
