    <h2> Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Our names are Emma, Bhavya, Briana, Alyssa, and Lily, and our company is <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Blazed</span>. Our company sells candles and candle holders. 
      We all love to have a nice relaxing day or afternoon, and what's better than to light a relaxing smelling candle? 
      We make all our products in the comfort of our homes and make them with good quality clean products. We have chosen 
      the materials for what we make our products out of very carefully, making sure we use the best quality materials to make the best 
      quality products. We have chosen to use soy wax instead of beeswax because soy wax tends to last a long time when lit, and the beeswax 
      tends to have a strong smell, so it is harder to get that natural scent to come through with the beeswax than it is with the soy wax.
     </p>

    <h2>
      Prices
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our team has put a lot of thought into deciding how to price our products. We have chosen to sell one candle holder 
      + one 0.5 ounce candle (rose candle + pebble candle holder OR jasmine candle + shell candle holder) for $8.00 total, 
      and one 8 ounce candles (peppermint or lavendar) is also going to be sold for $8.00.
    </p>
   
    <h2> 
      Our Process
    </h2>
   
    <p>
      Our process for making our candles starts with melting the soywax in a small pitcher over simering water. 
      Once the wax is melted, we add in a couple drops of one of our essential oils. (Lavendar, chamomile, or rose)
      Next, we placed the wick with a sticker at the bottom of the tin while using a metal holder to keep it in place.
      Then we poured the melted wax into the holder around the wick and let that sit for about 20 minutes. There you 
      have it, a perfect candle!
    </p>

    <h2>Pebble Candle Holders</h2>        
    <p>
      To make the pebble candle holders, we first went outside to find a variety of little pebbles to use. 
      Then we took a jar lid to use as the base for the candle. This makes an exceptional base because 
      if any wax were to spill out of the candle inside, it would be held in and not flow through the spaces 
      in between the rocks that let out light. After that, we heated up a hot glue gun and started to piece 
      the rocks together starting from the inside of the lid and going up, purposely creating spaces for the light 
      to come through. Once that is all dry, we took some twine, and wrapped it around the base of the candle holder 
      to make it look more cozy and friendly. Once that dries, it's done!
    </p>
      
  
    <h2>Shell Candle Holders</h2>
      
    <p>
      To make the shell candle holders, we first found some shells and a jar lid. Instead of using the jar lid 
      the same way we used it in the pebble candle holders, we only used the base of the jar lid to make it look 
      better. After this, we started to attach shells to the top, starting with the bigger ones near the bottom, 
      and adding the smaller shells on top. This creates a sturdy candle holder, as well as a nice and cute flower 
      shape. We then wrapped the bottom with twine like we did in the pebble candle holders. Now our shell candle 
      holder is done!

    <h2>Add-Ons</h2>

    <p>
      You can get two additional 0.5 ounce candles to go with your candle holder for only $2.00 extra (three 0.5 ounce candles total)! 
      Do you want to get a little gift basket type thing for a friend? Well, for only $15.00, 
      you can get one 8 ounce lavendar candle + one rose 0.5 ounce candle + one pebble candle holder! 
      One add-on that you can make for yourself is something to put your candle or candle holder 
      on, such as beads or sand!
