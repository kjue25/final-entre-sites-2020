    <h2> Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Our names are Emma, Bhavya, Briana, Alyssa, and Lily, and our company is <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Blazed</span>. Our company sells candles and candle holders. 
      We all love to have a nice relaxing day or afternoon, and what's better than to light a relaxing smelling candle? 
      We make all our products in the comfort of our homes and make them with good quality clean products. We have chosen 
      the materials for what we make our products out of very carefully, making sure we use the best quality materials to make the best 
      quality products. We have chosen to use soy wax instead of beeswax because soy wax tends to last a long time when lit, as well as 
      beeswax has a strong smell, so it is harder to get that natural smell of lavender or rose or chamomile with the beeswax than it is 
      with the soy wax.
     </p>

    <h2>
      Prices:
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our team has put a lot of thought into deciding how to price our products. We have chosen to sell the candle holders along with a 1oz. 
      candle to go inside for $8.00 total, and a price of $0.00 for our bigger _ounce candles.
    </p>
   
    <h2> 
      Our Process
    </h2>
   
    <p>
      Our process for making our candles starts with melting the soywax in a small pitcher over simering water. 
      Once the wax is melted, we add a couple drops of one of our essential oils.
      Next, we placed the wick with a sticker at the bottom of the tin well using a metal holder to keep it in place.
      Then we poured the melted wax into the holder and let it sit for about 20 minutes. There you have it, a perfect candle!

    <h2>Pebble Candle Holders:</h2>        
    <p>
      To make the pebble candle holders, we first went outside to find a variety of little pebbles to use. 
      Then we took a jar lid to use as the base for the candle. This would be an exceptional base because 
      if any wax were to spill out of the candle inside, it would be held in and not flow through the spaces 
      in between the rocks that let out light. After that, we heated up a hot glue gun and started to piece 
      the rocks together starting from the inside of the lid, purposely creating spaces for the light to come 
      through. Once that is all dry, we took some twine, and wrapped it around the base of the candle holder 
      to make it look more cozy and friendly. When that dries, it's done!
    </p>
      
  
    <h2>Shell Candle Holders:</h2>
      
    <p>
      To make the shell candle holders, we first found some shells and a jar lid. Instead of using the jar lid 
      the same way we used it in the pebble candle holders, we only used the base of the jar lid to make it look 
      better. After this, we started to attach shells to the top, starting with the bigger ones near the bottom, 
      and adding the smaller shells on top. This creates a sturdy candle holder, as well as a nice and cute flower 
      shape. We then wrapped the bottom with twine like we did in the pebble candle holders. Now our shell candle 
      holder is done!
      <br>
      Something you can add as your own cute and cozy touch to this product is a nice filler to put the candle on 
      top of, such as beads or sand!
