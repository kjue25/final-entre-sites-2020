    <h1> Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      Our names are Emma, Bhavya, Briana, Alyssa, and Lily, and our company is Blazed. Our company sells candles and candle holders. 
      We all love to have a nice relaxing day or afternoon and what is better than to have a nice relaxing candle. 
      We make all our products in the comfort of our homes and make them with good quality clean products. If we are to get invested in,
      we would use better materials for both the candle and the holders. For the candles we would use soy wax because it has less of a scent
      and we would get better containers that are more calming and less outgoing.
     </p>

    <p>
      The sales price for the candle holders is $5.00. </p>
     The sales price for the candles is $8.00.

      <h3> 
      Process
       </h3>
    <p>
      We made our candles by melting the soywax in a small pitcher over simering water. 
      Once the wax is melted, we add a couple drops of one of our essential oils.
      Next, we placed the wick with a sticker at the bottom of the tin well using a metal holder to keep it in place.
      Then we poured the melted wax into the holder and let it sit for about 20 minutes. There you have it, a perfect candle!
    
    </p>
    <p>
      The process of making the candle holders is simple, easy, and fun! 
      <br>
      Rock Candle Holders:
      <br>
      First, we went into our backyards 
      and collected some nice rocks that had a variety of shapes and colors.
      Next, we collected a jar lid to keep as the base for the candle. 
      This would be an adequate base because if any wax were to spill out of the candle that is put inside, 
      it would all be held in and not flow through the spaces in between the rocks that let out light. 
      Next, we heated up a hot glue gun and started to piece the rocks together from the inside of the lid, 
      purposely creating spaces. Finally, we let everything dry, and it's done!
      <br>
      <br>
      Shell Candle Holders:
      <br>
      For the shell candle holder, we got some shells and a jar lid to start. This time,
      we flipped the jar lid over and started attaching shells to the top. 
      The big ones went on the bottom and then we kept adding 
      smaller ones on top and in the spaces to create a strong base and pretty flower. 
      Something you can add as your own touch to this product is some niece
      filler to put the candle on top of, such as beads or sand.
