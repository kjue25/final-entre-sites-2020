    <h2>Our Candles</h2>
    <p> Our homemade candles come in 2 different scents (Peppermint and Lavendar). We make a conscious effort to 
        make our candles have a natural feel, to make you feel calm and happy. These candles come in an 8 ounce gold tin. We originally had our 
        candles come in brighter mandala holders, but we think that these holders will make you feel calmer.

        Here are some pictures of our candles

    <h2>Our Candle Holders</h2>
    <p>
        Our homemade candle holders are made with natural materials such as pebbles and shells. Our pebble candle holders are made in a way 
        where the lights can shine throught the little holes between the rocks. Our shell candle holders are made in a way where the light 
        shines from the top creating a glowing effect. The bottom of our candle holders are made from a jar lid wrapped in twine. Our candle 
        holders also come with one free additional 0.5 ounce candle to put inside (one rose 0.5 ounce candle + one pebble candle holder 
        OR one jasmine 0.5 ounce candle + one shell candle holder)!
