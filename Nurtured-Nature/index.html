    <h2>Company Story</h2>
        <p> 
            Our team brainstormed ideas for our product and found that all of us were interested in terrariums. One of our group members had a terrarium in her house that we used for inspiration to base our product off of. When we began the design of our product we first tried looking for containers similar to the ones our group member had. After we found one that was high quality and fit our aesthetic so we moved on to the content inside the container. We decided that we wanted three different themes for our products and that each (except reegular) would have a figurine that matched that environment, comign to our final themes; beach, forest, and regular. Our figurine are what differ us from our competitors as well as string so that our costomers can choose to hang up there terrariums. We continued adding and changing our design and materials until we came up with one that we knew would satisfie buyers.  
        </p>
