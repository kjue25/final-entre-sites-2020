    <h2>Company Story</h2>
        <p> 
            Our team was searching for inspiration when we realized that people are escpecially missing being outside during the pandemic, and a way that we could fix that was by bringing the outside in. We used this idea and a terrarium that one of our group members had in her house to create our nature capsules. We first found an "open" container that we could use to hold the nature. Then we chose elements of nature that we wanted to include in our capsules. We found that airplants were easy to maintain and ship and decided to make them our center peice. We continued adding and changing our products untill we came to the final themes: beach, forest and original.
        </p>

    <h2> About our product</h2>
        <p> Need a pop of color and vibrance in your life, well then our nature capsules are perfect for you! Our products come in three different themes; beach, forest and original. All themes come unassembled in organized plastic bags, with a peice of twine, and clear written instructions so that our customers can have fun putting together their product. All themes (except original) come with a figurine specific to the theme. </p>

    <h2> 
        Price of Products
    </h2>
    <p> Considering the value and quality of our materials, as well as the added cost of packing and shipping we decided to price all our nature capsules at $13, and our add-ons at $4. We believe this to be a reasonable price and hope you consider buying our product!
