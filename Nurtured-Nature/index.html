    <h2>Company Story</h2>
        <p> 
            Our team was searching for inspiration when we realized that people are especially missing being outside during the pandemic, and a way that we could fix that was by bringing the outside in. We used this idea and a terrarium that one of our group members had in her house to create our nature capsules. We first found an "open" container that we could use to hold the nature. Then we chose elements of nature that we wanted to include in our capsules. We found that air plants were easy to maintain and ship and decided to make them our centerpeice. We continued adding and changing our products until we came to the final themes: beach, forest and original.
        </p>

    <h2> About Our Product</h2>
        <p> Need a pop of color and vibrance in your life, well then our nature capsules are perfect for you! Our products come in three different themes; beach, forest and original. All themes come unassembled in organized plastic bags, with a peice of twine, and clearly written instructions so that our customers can have fun putting together their product. All themes (except original) come with a figurine specific to the theme. </p>
     
     <h2> Beach theme</h2>
        <p>
            Our beach themed nature capsule is a small sized, hangable, circular glass container with sand, seashells, an air plant, and a mini starfish.

            Our forest themed nature capsule is a small sized, hangable, circular glass container with sand, moss, an air plant, and a mini hedge hog figurine.

    <p> With each of our themes we also provide the option to get an extra material packs of either a hedgehog and moss or 2 starfish and seashells.</p>

    <h2> 
        Price of Products
    </h2>
    <p> Considering the value and quality of our materials, as well as the added cost of packing and shipping we decided to price all our nature capsules at $13, and our add-ons at $4. We believe this to be a reasonable price and hope you consider buying our product!
