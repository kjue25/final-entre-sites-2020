 Our Story
 </h4>
 <br>
 <h5>
  Hi there! We’re entre team 21! We’re  Lucy, Maureen, Vivian, Fiona and Gabi! Maureen has been obsessed with making our product (tassels) ever since she saw cute tassels appearing everywhere, backpacks, necklaces, earrings, even wall hangings! Jumping on to this new trend, she decided that she needed to go whole hog, and dive into the world of tassels. When Vivian saw what Maureen was creating, she just knew that this had to be their Entre product. The tassels were stylish, small, and simple, just what you want in a product. Lucy quickly became a master of cranking out the creative product, and Tassa was born. After phase 1 of entre class, Tassa gained two vital memebers, Fiona and Gabi. Fiona and Gabi swiftly became valuable components to the team! Today, Lucy, Maureen, Vivian, Gabi and Fiona want you, yes you! To invest in their products. With your help, we’ll be able to learn and grow as a company.
