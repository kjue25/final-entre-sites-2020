        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h3>Our Name </h3>
        <p>
                   Malie started while we were planning our prototype 
                for the first round of entre. Anna suggested that we 
                make heating pillows because it would be nice to have 
                something to relieve stress during COVID 19. 
                <br>
                Our company name, Malie, is the Hawaiian word for calm, 
                and that is what we want our customers to feel when using our pillows. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Our Story </h3>
        <p>
                    At first, we had multiple options for our products. We had options for embroidery, patterns, scents, and size.  
                    However, when we went over feedback after the prototype fair, we realized a few options we had might not be popular.
                <br>
                For example, we found that not everyone liked lavendar. We weren't sure if customers would be happier with other scents we picked, so we stuck with no scent. Another example was embroidery options. Future customers said on the feedback form that they probably wouldn't pay that much for embroidery. Because of this, we took that option down. 
                <br>
                Also, on our feedback form, we noticed that some of the questions asked were information put on the website. We later realized that with too much paragraphs, customers might not want to read them. 
                We now have more short and to the point paragraphs about our product so customers donâ€™t have to read long sentences and learn more about our product.

            At Malie, we love to work together and take specific roles each time. We usually assign roles in class, then help each other if they need help. 
             For product producing, Anna and Karina are in charge of making the pillows, and Iman and Sherlyn are in charge of packaging the pillows to satisfy customers.
