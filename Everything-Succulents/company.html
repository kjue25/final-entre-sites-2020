            and bring a scence of the great out doors to you, even amidst COVID-19. 
            Succulents and candles checked all the boxes being cute, artsy, and inspired by nature.

        Our Products!
    </h5>
    <h6>
        Our products here at Everything Succulents, we bring the great outdoors straight to you with macrame terrariums and candle succulents!
        Our terrariums come in a glass bowl with white rocks and a faux plant, so you don't have to remember to water them!
        Finally, a macrame cord is tied around, so you can hang your plant! 
        If you want, you can remove the cord, and have the plant sit on your desk, night stand or where ever you want!
        Our succculent candles are made with beeswax, and come in a glass jar! They will have a naturey scent, to fill your home with the sweet scent of the great outdoors. They'll look great anywhere!
