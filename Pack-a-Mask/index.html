            Every time you take off your mask, or bring it around with you, you bring unnecessary risks to your health and mask.<img src="Content3(1).png" style="float: right; padding-right: 50px; width: 150; height: 150;" alt="image4" class="popup1"></br>Instead of wasting the precious filters(N95 or otherwise), which are expensive and hard to come by, you can preserve</br>the lifespan of your mask’s filter. Pack-A-Mask is a double-layered bag of fabric, that is an additional layer of</br>protection, to keep away germs and bacteria from your mask. This washable and reusable mask bag has a button to keep</br>  your mask safe, all the while keeping a slight pocket of air at the top. This prevents germs and bacteria from</br>growing within a humid and damp environment. Finally, this bag also has a metal clasp to attach to your jeans, or bag</br>for easy portability. You won’t have to worry about looks either. This bag has patterned fabric, and bright colors,</br>that will make sure you won’t lose the bag, and will catch the attention of others.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Virus research(scroll down):</br>
            Viruses can be spread by many things including sneezes, coughs, and even when breathing normal air inside or out.<img src="Angry1.png" style="float: right; padding-right: 50px; width: 150; height: 150;" alt="image6" class="popup1"></br>Viruses can also be spread when you're sweating, like out on a run with your dog or playing games outdoors. Another</br>way viruses could be spread is by physical contact. For example, when you're shaking hands with someone, hugging a</br>friend, etc. When germs are being spread you could get sick. Some ways to prevent viruses are staying home when</br>your sick, cleaning things you’ve touched when you’re sick, and disinfecting frequently. Another way to prevent</br>spreading viruses is coughing or sneezing in a tissue, using hand sanitizer frequently, and most importantly,</br>washing your hands! Now, during Covid-19 people need to wear masks and wash their hands frequently right? Well, that’s</br>why we have made something to spice things up! That is why we have decided to sell mask holders to better your day</br>out in the world and help prevent viruses and bigger problems that have a huge impact.</br></br>Sources:</br><a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/kids/germs.html#:~:text=Most%20germs%20are%20spread%20through,then%20touching%20your%20own%20nose." target="_blank;" class="resources">Kids Health</a></br><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/stop-the-spread-of-germs.pdf" target="_blank;" class="resources">CDC Safety Poster</a>
