    <h4>Welcome to Pack-A-Mask!</h4>
    <!--like pacman? lol-->
    <!--potential motto: keeping your mask and YOU safe! :)-->

    <div class="scroll2"> 
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Every time you take off your mask, or bring it around with you, you <img src="Pack-A-Mask.jpg" style="float: right; width: 600; height: 400;" alt="image4" class="popup1">bring unnecessary risks to your health and mask. Instead of wasting the precious filters(N95 or otherwise), which are expensive and hard to come by, you can preserve the lifespan of your mask’s filter. Pack-A-Mask is a double-layered<br> bag of fabric, that is an additional layer of protection, to keep away germs <br>and bacteria from your mask. This washable and reusable mask bag has a button <br>to keep your mask safe, all the while keeping a slight pocket of air at the <br>top. This prevents germs and bacteria from growing within a humid and damp environment. Finally, this bag also has a metal clasp to attach to your jeans, <br>or bag for easy portability. You won’t have to worry about looks either. This<br> bag has patterned fabric, and bright colors, that will make sure you won’t <br>lose the bag, and will catch the attention of others.</p>

    <h4>Our research:</h4>

    <div class="scroll3"> 
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Viruses can be spread by many things including sneezes, coughs, and even when breathing normal air inside or out.<img src="Angry1.png" style="float: right; padding-right: 50px; width: 150; height: 150;" alt="image6" class="popup1"></br>Viruses can also be spread when you're sweating, like out on a run with your dog or playing games outdoors. Another</br>way viruses could be spread is by physical contact. For example, when you're shaking hands with someone, hugging a</br>friend, etc. When germs are being spread you could get sick. Some ways to prevent viruses are staying home when</br>your sick, cleaning things you’ve touched when you’re sick, and disinfecting frequently. Another way to prevent</br>spreading viruses is coughing or sneezing in a tissue, using hand sanitizer frequently, and most importantly,</br>washing your hands! Now, during Covid-19 people need to wear masks and wash their hands frequently right? Well, that’s</br>why we have made something to spice things up! That is why we have decided to sell mask holders to better your day</br>out in the world and help prevent viruses and bigger problems that have a huge impact.</br></br>Sources:</br><a href="https://kidshealth.org/en/kids/germs.html#:~:text=Most%20germs%20are%20spread%20through,then%20touching%20your%20own%20nose." target="_blank;" class="resources">Kids Health</a></br><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/stop-the-spread-of-germs.pdf" target="_blank;" class="resources">CDC Safety Poster</a>
