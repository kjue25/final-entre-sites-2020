        Aubrey:</br></br>
        When we first got together to figure out what we were going to do for this Entre project, we had many general ideas, but no concrete plan. We started out wanting to make products of stuff we enjoyed, but after being inspired, I mentioned making something relevant to what’s happening now. From this, and some more brainstorming, we decided to make mask bags, after realising a problem. The problem we thought of was that mask filters were being overused, and getting extra dirty, when you hold them in your hands, and let the masks filter the air as you walk by.</br></br>

        ^Here is a vector image of one of our prototypes!^</br></br>
        As we refined our idea of mask bags, we started thinking of patterns, designs, and threads. Some of the struggles we had were thinking of what colors to use, and in the end, we decided to start simple, with a few basic colors(red, orange, yellow, green, etc). After deciding on the fabric, we also struggled with what mechanism we would use to open and close the bag. We first ruled out zippers and velcro, because they are harder to sew on, and are more expensive. In the end, we decided to use plastic-sew on buttons and small hairties, because they were the cheapest, and would last the longest. We also found that it is super easy to close and open, because you just have to loop the elastic(hair ties) around the button.</br></br>
        Ally:</br></br>
        Once we were getting prepared for the materials we were using, we wanted to add some things that would make things interesting, or in a way want people to buy it. Since people have different preferences we wanted to add different colors and designs to the bags. When we found that it would be easier to search on secure websites like Amazon and Michaels we started searching for affordable materials to use like colorful clothes, threads, elastic hair ties, and metal loops. Aubrey and I had some times where we had trouble finding affordable things or finding if it was relevant. At the end of the day, we had found what a good name, as well as getting the motivation and ideas to continue to improve our product!</br></br>
        After we thought about our team’s prototype we had a discussion about our team’s name. We wanted a name that would be catchy and easy to remember. While we were thinking of names, it took us a couple of days to get it, when we had finally made a list of some names that we wanted to try out. We thought that “Pack-A-Mask” sounded catchy and it would be relevant because of it having to do something with a mask! When thinking of our name we thought it would make a lot of sense because of our prototype being a mask holder.</br></br>
